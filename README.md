# UniFusion: Unified Multi-view Fusion Transformer for Spatial-Temporal Representation in Birdâ€™s-Eye-View

## City-based split
This repo contains the "city-based" split proposed in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08536). 
* Trianing set: the samples collected in `singapore-queenstown` and `singapore-hollandvillage`.
* Validation set: the samples collected in `singapore-onenorth` and `boston-seaport`.

The sizes of training and validation sets of "city-based" split are 26,093 and 8,056. For comparision, the sizes of the vanilla training and validation sets are 28,130 and 6,019.

We also provide a `nuscenes_city_based_split.py` to generate the city-based split.

## Demo

We also provide a demo of our method.
